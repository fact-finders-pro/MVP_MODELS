Users can put investment strategies to work by trading global stocks, ETFs, options, futures and fractional shares through Webull's trading platform, which seamlessly integrates market data and information, its user community, and investor education resources.

Webull began in 2016 in the city of Changsha, China, as a free app aggregating market data for users globally. Users of the Webull app mostly used it to obtain market data for their personal investment strategies and then executed those strategies on other brokerage platforms. Webull established Webull Financial LLC on May 24, 2017, to be a licensed broker-dealer in the U.S., allowing its users to execute their investment strategies directly on the Webull platform. FINRA approved Webull to operate as a broker in the U.S. on January 4, 2018. As the Webull platform grew, Webull sought diversified investments to continue its expansion in the U.S. and globally. To facilitate investments from global investors and an eventual listing on a global stock exchange, on September 2, 2019, Webull Corporation was established to as the ultimate parent and holding company for Webull’s global business.

Webull continues to expand by adding new entities in new markets.

The clinical impact of cell therapy in treating cancer has been proven, but this therapeutic approach has several limitations, especially in manufacturing, leaving extremely sick patients waiting for treatment and desperate for hope.
Since cell therapy is currently produced for a single patient at a time, it is expensive to manufacture, requiring significant time and resources, and is difficult to scale. 

Preclinical and clinical scientists, as well as commercial cell therapy manufacturers also lack the options to fully automate their manufacturing process quickly, safely, cost-effectively, and at the scale they need.

The Cell Shuttle is an automated and closed end-to-end manufacturing solution that is flexible and scalable, enabling customers to run exact processes specified for their cell therapy. Compared with the current manual manufacturing processes for cell therapy, the Cell Shuttle’s next-generation automated manufacturing solution has 10 times the scalability (meaning 10 times more patient doses can be produced simultaneously), enables a three-fold reduction in process failure rates, and will reduce the per-patient manufacturing cost by up to 70 percent for most processes.",Cellares is a life sciences technology company that develops the Cell Shuttle to automate cell therapy manufacturing.,2019-01-01,active,for_profit,51-100,3531,2961,-0.4,-0.6,6.1,https://www.linkedin.com/company/cellares-corporation,6236.0,8399.33333333333,-0.361588861588862,0.5603,398.0,2.1761,2610639.0,355000000.0,355000000.0,255000000.0,3.0,255000000.0,series_c,9.0,late_stage_venture,series_c,private,N/A,0.0,0.0,"Biotechnology,Life Science,Manufacturing,Medical,Therapeutics","South San Francisco,California,United States,North America",South San Francisco,California,United States,3.0,"Alex Pesch,Fabian Gerlinghaus,Omar Kurdi",Independent,0.0,24.0,19.0,unknown,183.0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0

Webull serves more than 20 million registered users globally, providing retail investors with 24/7 access to global financial markets. Users can put investment strategies to work by trading global stocks, ETFs, options, futures and fractional shares through Webull's trading platform, which seamlessly integrates market data and information, its user community, and investor education resources.

Webull began in 2016 in the city of Changsha, China, as a free app aggregating market data for users globally. Users of the Webull app mostly used it to obtain market data for their personal investment strategies and then executed those strategies on other brokerage platforms. Webull established Webull Financial LLC on May 24, 2017, to be a licensed broker-dealer in the U.S., allowing its users to execute their investment strategies directly on the Webull platform. FINRA approved Webull to operate as a broker in the U.S. on January 4, 2018. As the Webull platform grew, Webull sought diversified investments to continue its expansion in the U.S. and globally. To facilitate investments from global investors and an eventual listing on a global stock exchange, on September 2, 2019, Webull Corporation was established to as the ultimate parent and holding company for Webull’s global business.

Webull continues to expand by adding new entities in new markets. Due to the nature of the brokerage business, every market in which Webull operates requires it to establish a local entity and apply for a brokerage license from the securities regulators in that jurisdiction.

Project management that people actually want to use.

Taking a big picture view on the experience we have in working, Leantime steps away from the traditional approaches of task management and seeks to solve a bigger issue: How do we stay engaged and consistent with the purpose and value of our work? 

Adoption of PM tools is often cumbersome and most people have a love-hate relationship with their tools. By incorporating AI and principles of neuroscience & behavioral science, Leantime works to make the work that a user is doing personal, easy (don't have to figure out workflows), goal focused and engaging. 

Some of our features include:
- Kanban, List, & Table views for To Dos
- Subtasks & Dependencies with a visual Kanban overview
- Goals
- Idea Management
- Milestones
- Strategy Boards (SWOT, Business Model Canvas, Lean, +more)
- High level strategic one pager 
- Timesheets and time tracking 
- Reports & Analytics
- Retrospectives / Project reviews
- Portfolio overview
- Document & File management
- ADHD friendly & inclusive reading themes
- And more

Our mobile application (Urgently Health), available for both Apple and Android devices, allows patients to discover local, available, medical care facilities based on their specific medical needs, along with estimated wait times so they can be seen and treated as soon as possible.

The App also allows patients to browse providers based on specialties and services offered, as well as by insurances accepted. This way, patients avoid surprises when arriving at the front desk.

Additional patient benefits include:
-- Filling out paperwork before arriving at urgent care facilities, hospitals, and other walk-in medical providers
-- Seeing medical care facility information, including locations, hours of operation, estimated wait times, contact information, specialties and services offered, and insurances accepted
-- Storage of their medical forms, medical history, pre-existing conditions, etc.
-- Reduction of wait times in hospitals, clinics, emergency rooms, and other medical care providers
-- Reduction of stress associated with unplanned, last-minute care and medical emergencies

Urgently Health also notifies the hospital or clinic a patient chooses that they are on their way to them, providing healthcare facilities with an approximate travel time. This feature allows providers to expect patients and better prepare for their arrival before they get there. This is vitally important during emergencies where mere minutes can make a difference!

Our accompanying Web Platform allows hospitals and clinics who accept walk-in patients to process them more effectively and with less confusion than in the past. When healthcare facilities use our Platform, they expand their visibility and streamline their day-to-day operations. This, in turn, increases their preparedness and allows them to discover and overcome bottlenecks, leading to more effective and efficient service, greater patient satisfaction and retention, and decreased costs.

With patient information on-hand before they arrive, providers can assign severity, pre-triage, and verify information before their patients arrive. The Platform also provides healthcare administrators with statistics such as hot-times, most common ailments, and historical wait-times to mitigate over and under-staffing and ensure preparation.",Humanizing Healthcare,2019-03-01,active,for_profit,1-10,167416,158148,0.0,1.0,-0.1,https://www.linkedin.com/company/urgentlyhealth,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5572,238.0,2.2011,30181969.0,250000.0,250000.0,250000.0,1.0,250000.0,pre_seed,1.0,seed,pre_seed,private,N/A,0.0,0.0,"Android,Electronic Health Record (EHR),Emergency Medicine,Health Care,Hospital,iOS,mHealth,Mobile,Mobile Apps","New York,New York,United States,North America",New York,New York,United States,2.0,unknown,Independent,0.0,0.0,0.0,unknown,3.0,0,0,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1

We're helping centers adapt to agents' demands for flexibility, where 40-year best practices now fall short. We killed 8-hour schedules, mandatory OT, commuting, and low-income wages.

We built a flexible contact center, designed for a flexible and modern workforce. We made it possible for brands, and even BPOs, to pay competitively, even as wages increase. Imagine the CX professionals you'd attract with flexibility and higher pay!

And contact centers are better when they're flexible...

ShyftOff helps CX teams staff perfectly as volume fluctuates throughout the days, weeks, months, or seasons. Flexible teams can even surge up for the unexpected.

ShyftOff also helps combat rising costs of customer service. A productive hour pricing model saves 35%+ by eliminating shrinkage and stabilizing occupancy.
